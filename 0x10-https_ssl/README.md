0x10-https_ssl

This repository contains the source code and configuration files for implementing HTTPS and SSL/TLS encryption in a web server. The code is part of the larger project for an Airbnb clone (AirBnB_clone_v2).
Description

In this project, we aim to enhance the security of our web server by enabling HTTPS support using SSL/TLS encryption. This ensures that all communication between the web server and clients is encrypted and secure.

The main files and directories in this repository are:

    0-clean_web.sh: Bash script for cleaning up any previous web server configurations and SSL certificates.
    1-install_nginx_web_server.sh: Bash script for installing and configuring the Nginx web server.
    2-create_a_self_signed_SSL_certificate.sh: Bash script for generating a self-signed SSL certificate for testing purposes.
    3-ssl_termination: Directory containing the Nginx configuration files for enabling SSL termination.
    README.md: This file, providing an overview of the repository and instructions.
