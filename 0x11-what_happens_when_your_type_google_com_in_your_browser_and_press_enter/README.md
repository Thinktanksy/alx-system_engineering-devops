Introduction

When you type "google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a series of steps are triggered that ultimately lead to the display of Google's search page. In this section, we will provide an overview of the process and set the stage for the subsequent sections.
DNS Lookup

The journey begins with a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. In this section, we will explore how the browser resolves the human-readable domain name "google.com" into an IP address through DNS servers.
Establishing a TCP/IP Connection

Once the IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a TCP/IP connection to the web server hosting the Google website. In this section, we will delve into the details of the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) and how they enable reliable communication.
HTTP Request

With the connection established, the browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the web server. This section will explain the structure and components of an HTTP request and the information it carries.
Server-Side Processing

Upon receiving the HTTP request, the web server initiates server-side processing. This section will explore how the server handles the request, executes necessary scripts or retrieves static files, and interacts with other components like databases and application servers.
HTTP Response

Following the server-side processing, the web server generates an HTTP response. This section will delve into the structure and content of an HTTP response, including status codes, headers, and the actual data sent back to the browser.
Rendering the Webpage

Armed with the HTTP response, the browser begins rendering the webpage. This section will cover the rendering process, including parsing HTML, executing JavaScript, applying CSS styles, and displaying the final visual representation of the Google search page.
Conclusion

In conclusion, the journey from typing "google.com" to the display of the search page involves a complex series of steps. Understanding these steps and the underlying technologies, such as DNS lookup, TCP/IP connection establishment, HTTP requests and responses, server-side processing, and webpage rendering, provides a deeper appreciation for the seamless browsing experience we enjoy every day.
